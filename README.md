# Bad Code

This repository contains standalone R scripts that are not guaranteed to work.
It is here as an example of what not to do when writing code, even for a
single analysis. All of the code can be found in the directory 
[**the_horror/**][0].

## History

```
Jun  5  2012 MATRIXmlFunk.r
Jun  5  2012 OLDmultilocusFunctions.r
Jun 18  2012 multilocusFunctions0.0.2.r
Jun 19  2012 multilocusFunctions0.0.3.r
Jun 20  2012 multilocusFunctions0.0.4.r
Jun 21  2012 multilocusFunctions0.0.1.r
Jun 22  2012 multilocusFunctions0.0.5.r
Jun 22  2012 multilocusFunctions0.0.6.r
Nov  4  2012 multilocusFunctions.r
Nov  4  2012 multilocusFunctions0.0.7.r
```

These scripts are what eventually turned into the R package [*poppr*][1]. This
was before I had learned of version control or even the concept of vectors in
R. In the spring and summer of 2012, I was attempting to write an R function to
analyze the Index of Association because the only available programs at the
time were incapable of doing so. 

I was instructed to keep versions of my code, but I didn't quite know how to do
that, so I literally kept a different version each day, but after 7 days that
quickly became intractable.

## What's in a name?

The name PiG Multitool is one of the first suggested names for *poppr*, but was
vetoed by myself and others.

### THORNY: THe case fOR not using acroNYms

Below are some of the initial suggestions for the package name that were vetoed
for various reasons mainly involving their search-ability and connotations. I
will not reveal the name of those who came up with these [abominations][2] (but I 
could be persuaded with :beer:).

 - **R** **P**ackage for population **G**enetics
   - RPG Multitool
   - RPG Supertool
 - The R package for **P**opulation Genetics **iTools**
   - PiT Multitool
   - PiTools
   - PiTools?
 - The R package for **P**opulation **I**nference and **G**enetics **Tools**
   - PiG Multitool
   - PiGTools?
 - **POP**ulation **A**nalysis in **R**
   - popar
 - **PO**pulation genetics **W**ith th**E** package **R**
   - POWeR
 - BrowniePoints (After A.H.D. Brown)
 - CastorPOP (*Castor* is the Beaver genus)
