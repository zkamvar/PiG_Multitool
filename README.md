# Bad Code

This repository contains standalone R scripts that are not guaranteed to work.
It is here as an example of what not to do when writing code, even for a
single analysis. 

## History

These scripts are what eventually turned into the R package [*poppr*][0]. This
was before I had learned of version control or even the concept of vectors in
R. In the spring and summer of 2012, I was attempting to write an R function to
analyze the Index of Association because the only available programs at the
time were incapable of doing so. 

I was instructed to keep versions of my code, but I didn't quite know how to do
that, so I literally kept a different version each day, but after 7 days that
quickly became intractable.

## What's in a name?

The name PiG Multitool is one of the first suggested names for *poppr*, but was
vetoed by myself and others.

### THORNY: THe case fOR not using acroNYms

Below are some of the initial suggestions for the package name that were vetoed
for various reasons mainly involving their search-ability and connotations. I
will not reveal the name of those who came up with these abominations (but I 
could be persuaded with :beer:).

   - RPG Multitool
   - RPG Supertool
 - The R package for **P**opulation Genetics **iTools**

   - PiTools?
 - The R package for **P**opulation **I**nference and **G**enetics **Tools**
   - PiG Multitool

   - popar
 - **PO**pulation genetics **W**ith th**E** package **R**
